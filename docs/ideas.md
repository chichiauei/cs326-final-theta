#### Innovative Idea
We plan to develop a website that allows users to create and modify their personal website (website like their resume) without programming. Our application allows users to use drag and drop tools to modify their website. Users may also add friends and cite any of them in their projects or working experiences. Our application would be somewhat similar to [Wix.com](https://www.wix.com/); however, instead of creating any kinds of websites (what Wix.com does), our application is mainly used for building user's personal website in linkedIn style so that it enable interactions between users while Wix.com does not.

#### Important Components
1. The user has to login the website so that he can get the access to modify his own website. Otherwise, He can only write messages to pages.
2. The users can write their own page by code. In addition, the server will provide serveral templates to them for convenience. 
3. All changes will be submitted to the server.
