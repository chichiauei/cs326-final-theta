#### Innovative Idea
we plan to develop a website that allows users to create and modify their personal website (website like their resume) without programming. Users may also add friends and cite any of them in their projects or working experiences.

#### Important Components
1. The user has to login the website so that he can get the access to modify his own website. Otherwise, He can only write messages to pages.
2. The users can write their own page by code. In addition, the server will provide serveral templates to them for convenience. 
3. All changes will be submitted to the server.
